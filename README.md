Our Trading Bot is focused around the sentimental analysis of the top stocks from the S and P 500 from Twitter. The stocks that gain positive attention on Twitter are then analyzed through our stock_analysis which compares the 9-days and 21-days moving average in order to determine whether the stock should be recommended to be purchased. The higher the 9-day moving averaged compared to the 21-day corresponds to a greater upward trend in price.
